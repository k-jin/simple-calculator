# Javascript Calculator

This is a simple Javascript Calculator, though 'calculator' is a bit of a misnomer. This was a class project where the ultimate goal was to replicate the Mac calculator: http://www.guidebookgallery.org/pics/gui/applications/office/calculator/macosx103-1-1.png.

It was both a design exercise and introduction to Javascript. I have not yet implemented actual calculator functions but the functioning buttons include all the numbers, the decimal point, the positive and negative sign, and clear button work. Once I find time, as an exercise, I will implement the actual calculator function.
